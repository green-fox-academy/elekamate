            I love to design compleey systems with high levels of automation including AI
            and robotics.I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the
            ehuman experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to
            protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power comes great
            responsibility.

            All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions,
            such as reading data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic
            arithmetic.(The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is know that etc.)
